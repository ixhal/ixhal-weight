### Hello!
I created this script because people was requesting it and I knew it would only take a few minutes to create.<br>
This script slows the player down based on the weight in their inventory.<br>

### Frameworks supported: 
qb-core.<br>
esxlegacy.<br>

### Remember to go into the config.lua file and set your framework/inventory.

### Inventories supported:
Any inventory that uses qbcore to handle items.<br>
Default esx inventory or anything that supports its default items.<br>
ox-inventory. (set Inventory = 'ox_inventory') in the config.lua file.<br>

### ENJOY
